        <h7>Personal Statement</h7>
    <hr>
        <p>Hi there! Im Aynsley, a student designer from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently enjoying exploring different ways to create digital magic. Although my work is often created for the computerised realm, my two favourite tools will forever be pen and paper. Sketching out ideas quickly and spontaneously, I believe, is how great things happen. I am particularly interested in carrying hand drawn illustrations into the digital world and I love exploring subtle interactions. I am a forward thinker and love any chance to collaborate with people to create exciting new things!
