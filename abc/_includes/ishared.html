        <h6>Everyday Magic was a brief set by the IxDA student design challange. The aim was to focus on small interactions that you can improve in a massive way. Something that creates a simple, yet powerful moment.</h6>
        
        <p>We can throw loose change into a charity box, but how long will it lie there for? We can sign up with an organisation to donate monthly, but how many of us are prepared to make that commitment? What if there was a simple, everyday magic solution to the problem of giving to charity?</p>
