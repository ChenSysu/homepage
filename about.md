# about me

I’m a Ph.D. candidate at Institute of Logic and Cognition, Department of Philosophy, Sun Yat-sen University, China. I’m also a Guest Ph.D. candidate at Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

I obtained my master degree in Logic from Sun Yat-sen University and did a bachelor of Computer Science at Guangzhou University, China.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
